# MediaMonksFrontendChallenge
This project was thoroughly enjoyable and challenging. 

The 'enter' file is the 'loading' page with the sitting monk, which gives access to the intro page of the website. 

I used a pagination element for navigation. The left double arrows will take you to the intro page; the right double arrows will take you to the last page; the before and after arrow work for all pages. I thought about JS for this but Stackoverflow scolded people for abusing the perfectly suitable html links, so I stuck with that. The loading page is called 'go' in the navigation; the intro page is called 'intro', then the 8 steps towards digital enlightenment are 1-8.

I've included the icon in the tab; the links on the contact page are working.
