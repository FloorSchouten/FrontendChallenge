# MediaMonksFrontendChallenge
This project was thoroughly enjoyable and challenging. 

The 'enter' file is the 'loading' page with the sitting monk, which gives access to the intro page of the website. 

I used a pagination element for navigation with single and double arrows for scrolling, and numbers to go directly to a page. The loading page is called 'go' in the navigation; the intro page is called 'intro', then the 8 steps towards digital enlightenment are 1-8.

I've included the icon in the tab.
