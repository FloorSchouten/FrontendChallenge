# MediaMonksFrontendChallenge
This project was thoroughly enjoyable and challenging. At first daunting, then a trove of dilemmas and solutions. 

Please start the project by opening the 'enter' file. 

This page has the sitting monk on it. I made a clickable quote to instruct the user to start the website. 

The first page (named it intro) gives access to the rest of the pages. These pages have background images and must be scrollable. I decided to cut up the background image in 16:9 scale images and use these for the backgrounds. For the last page, I contemplated having the image push against the black background but I couldn't reproduce what I managed earlier.

Changing the font worked out. About the underlining: I could change the heavy lines to a lighter version but the underlining wouldn't fit properly, so I changed it back to default underlining. Changing the color the SVG-file with the logo proved an interesting challenge, but I made it work with 'fill' instead of 'color'.

I used a pagination element for navigation. The original page has arrows in the margins for navigation as well: I opted for a back-scroll arrow in the pagination (I had the arrows installed but the text started to comically show up in angles as well and I had trouble to control this). In the navigation, the double arrows will take you to either the intro page or the last page; the before and after arrow work for all pages. I thought about JS for this but Stackoverflow scolded people for abusing the perfectly suitable html links, so I stuck with that. The loading page is called 'go'; the intro page is called 'i', then the 8 steps towards digital enlightenment are 1-8.

I've included the icon in the tab; the links on the contact page are working.
